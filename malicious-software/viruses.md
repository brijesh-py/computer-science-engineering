A computer virus is a type of malware that is designed to replicate itself and spread to other computers. Viruses attach their malicious code to legitimate programs or files, and when these infected files are executed, the virus activates and begins its harmful activities. Here is an overview of the typical working of computer viruses:

1. **Infection:**
   - The virus needs to find a way to enter a target system. This can occur through infected files, email attachments, malicious websites, or removable storage media like USB drives.

2. **Attachment:**
   - The virus attaches itself to a host file, which is often a legitimate and commonly used program or document. This host file can be an executable (.exe) file, a script, or even a document file.

3. **Execution:**
   - When the infected host file is executed by a user or a system process, the virus code is activated. This usually happens when the user runs the infected program or opens the infected document.

4. **Replication:**
   - Once activated, the virus seeks to replicate itself by attaching its code to other files on the same system. This can involve modifying existing files or creating new ones with the virus code.

5. **Propagation:**
   - The virus spreads to other systems by various means. For instance, it may replicate itself into files on shared networks, email itself to contacts in the victim's address book, or use other communication methods to transfer to other computers.

6. **Payload:**
   - Viruses often carry a payload, which is the actual malicious activity they are designed to perform. This can range from simple activities like displaying messages to more harmful actions such as deleting files, stealing information, or causing system instability.

7. **Concealment:**
   - To evade detection, viruses often employ techniques to hide their presence. This may include encrypting their code, using rootkit functionality to manipulate system functions, or employing polymorphic techniques to change their appearance.

8. **Activation Trigger:**
   - Some viruses include an activation trigger that determines when the payload will be executed. This trigger can be based on a specific date, the number of times the virus has replicated, or other conditions.

9. **Detection Evasion:**
   - Viruses attempt to evade detection by antivirus software through various means. They may encrypt their code, change their appearance (polymorphism), or use stealth techniques to avoid being easily identified.

10. **Countermeasures:**
    - Antivirus programs, security patches, and user awareness are essential countermeasures against viruses. Regularly updating antivirus software, applying security patches, and exercising caution when opening files or clicking on links can help prevent virus infections.

It's important to note that the term "virus" is often used colloquially to refer to various types of malware, even though not all malware technically fits the definition of a virus. The term is commonly used as a generalization for different malicious software.
