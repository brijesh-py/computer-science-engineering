### **How do resistors work?**

The amount of current passing through a resistor is determined by its resistance value. The greater the resistance, the lesser will be the flow of current. Resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). For example, a 10-ohm resistor will allow a current of 0.1 amperes at a potential difference of 1 volt.

### **Types of resistors**

There are many types of resistors, classified based on their construction material, resistance value, power rating, and physical size. Here are some common types of resistors:

* **Fixed Resistors:** These are the most common type of resistors whose resistance value is fixed and cannot be changed.

* **Variable Resistors:** Their resistance value can be changed. These include Potentiometer and Rheostat.

* **Dependent Resistors:** Their resistance value depends on external factors like light, temperature or voltage. For example, the resistance of a photoresistor varies with light intensity.

* **Special Purpose Resistors:** These are used for specific functions, such as handling high power or working at high frequencies. For example, wire-wound resistors can withstand higher power, while RF resistors are suitable for radio frequency applications.

## **What is a capacitor?**

A capacitor is an electrical device that stores electric charge to create an electric field. It can be represented by two metal plates that are parallel to each other and separated by an insulating material called a dielectric.

### **How does a capacitor work?**

When a capacitor is connected to a battery, positive charges are deposited on one plate and negative charges on the other plate. This process creates an electric field. When the battery is removed, the charge remains on the plates, allowing the capacitor to store energy for a period of time.

The storage capacity of a capacitor is called **Capacitance** and it is measured in Farad. The higher the capacitance, the more charge the capacitor can store.

### **Types of capacitors**

There are also many types of capacitors, which are classified based on their construction material, capacitance value, voltage rating, and physical size. Here are some common types of capacitors:

* **Electrolytic Capacitors:** These have high capacitance, but they must be polarized, which means they must be connected in the correct polarity.
* **Film Capacitors:** These provide higher precision and stability, but they can cost more.
* **Tantalum Capacitors:** These are smaller and have higher capacitance, but can get hot during operation.

### **Uses of Capacitor**

Capacitors are used in electronic circuits for a wide variety of functions, such as:

* storing electrical energy

I hope this explanation helps you understand capacitors.

## **What is Diode?**

A diode is a fundamental electronic device that conducts electric current primarily in one direction and blocks it in the opposite direction. It is considered a semiconductor device because it is made of semiconductor materials (such as silicon or germanium). It is often called a "one-way valve" because it allows electrical flow in only one direction.

### **How does a diode work?**

A diode has two terminals, called **Anode** and **Cathode**. When a positive voltage is applied to the anode and a negative voltage to the cathode, current flows across the p-n junction. This is called **Forward Bias**.

However, when the polarity is reversed, i.e. a negative voltage is applied to the anode and a positive voltage to the cathode, very little current flows across the p-n junction. This is called **Reverse Bias**.

### **Types of diode**

There are different types of diodes, which are classified based on their construction material, voltage rating, current capacity and special functions. Here are some common types of diodes:

* **P-N Junction Diode:** This is the most common type of diode, made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or germanium.
* **Zener Diode:** This is a special type of diode that is designed to have a reverse breakdown at a certain voltage. It is used as a voltage regulator.

Unlike traditional bulbs, LEDs are much more efficient, meaning they can produce the same or greater amount of light while using less energy.

### **How does LED work?**

When current passes through an LED, the electrons in its semiconductor material gain energy. When these electrons return to their ground state, they release excess energy in the form of light. The colour of the light emitted depends on the semiconductor material used in the LED.

Furthermore, it can also be used as an **electronic switch**, which means it can control the flow of electric current. The transistor is a fundamental component of modern electronics and is considered one of the most important inventions of the 20th century.

### **How does a transistor work?**

Transistors usually have three terminals, which are called **Base**, **Collector** and **Emitter**. Depending on the voltage applied between these terminals, the transistor can control the current flowing from the collector to the emitter. A small **base current** can control a large **collector current**, allowing the transistor to act as an amplifier.

There are two main types of transistors: **n-p-n (NPN)** and **p-n-p (PNP)**. Each of these types works slightly differently to correspond to the voltage applied to the terminals of the transistor.

These circuits are made up of transistors, resistors, capacitors and other electronic components. The most important feature of ICs is their integration, which means that all these components are built together on a small chip. This integration makes them compact, efficient, and relatively inexpensive.

### **How does IC work?**

Its internal workings may vary depending on the function of the specific IC. However, in general, ICs have input terminals that receive external signals, internal circuits that process these signals, and output terminals that transmit the processed signals. Some ICs perform simple tasks, such as implementing a logic gate, while other ICs are extremely complex, such as being an entire computer processor or graphics processor.

### **Types of IC**

## **What is a relay?**

A relay is an electrically operated switch that can control a high-power circuit by a low-power circuit. It is also used to connect electrically "insulated" circuits. In simple words, it is a small switch that can turn a large amount of power on or off using less electricity.

### **How does a relay work?**

Typically, a relay consists of a magnet and one or more electrical contacts. When the low-power circuit is turned on, it activates the magnet. This active magnet opens or closes the contacts, thus controlling high-power circuits.

## **What is Varistor?**

A varistor is an **electrical protection device** that protects the circuit from damage caused by sudden **voltage surges**. It is also called **Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV)**. It is a kind of "safety valve" that allows electric current to pass through smoothly under normal circumstances, but when the voltage suddenly increases, it absorbs the higher voltage, protecting the rest of the circuit.

### **How ​​does this work?**

The varistor consists of several layers made of metal oxide (such as zinc oxide). There is a certain limit of voltage between these layers that it can tolerate. When normal voltage is applied, current easily passes through these layers. But when the voltage suddenly increases, the resistance between the layers decreases and the varistor absorbs the higher voltage, diverting it towards the ground. This protects the rest of the circuit from damage.

### **Types of Varistor:**

## **What is a thermistor?**

A thermistor is a type of **resistor** whose resistance **changes substantially with change in temperature**. In other words, as the temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor increases, and as the temperature decreases, its resistance decreases. Due to this characteristic, the thermistor is used to **measure temperature**.

### **How ​​does this work?**

The thermistor is made of semiconductor material, which is a special type of solid material. The number of free electrons in this material depends on temperature. When the temperature increases, more electrons are released, making it easier for electric current to flow and less resistance. Conversely, when the temperature is low, fewer electrons are free, making it more difficult for current to flow and resulting in higher resistance.

### **Types of thermistor:**

* **NTC (PTC) thermistor:** This type of thermistor (Negative Temperature Coefficient) is **the most common**. As mentioned above, its resistance **increases with increasing temperature**.
* **PTC (NTC) thermistor:** This type of thermistor (Positive Temperature Coefficient) is less common. Its resistance **increases with increasing temperature**, but beyond a certain point it increases very rapidly.

### **Uses of thermistor:**

* **Temperature Measurement**: Thermistors are used to measure temperature in a variety of applications, such as in thermometers, car engines, food storage, and in medical devices.
* **Over-current Protection**: Some thermistors are used in circuits to protect against over-current. As the temperature increases (often due to excessive current), the resistance also increases, limiting the current.
* **Automatic Control**: Thermistors can be used to control devices based on temperature, for example, in thermostats or heating systems.

### **Advantages of thermistor:**

* **Sensitive and accurate temperature measurement**
* **Small size and light weight**
* **Durable and reliable**
* **cost-effective**

## **What is a transformer?**

A transformer is a stationary electrical device that **transfers** electrical energy from one circuit to another, **changing the voltage and current levels**. This means that it can transform low voltage to high voltage (step-up transformer) or vice versa (step-down transformer). It works with **AC (Alternating Current)**, not DC (Direct Current).

### **How does a transformer work?**

The transformer is made up of two main parts:

* **Primary Coil:** This coil receives the input voltage.
* **Secondary Coil:** This coil produces the output voltage.

Both coils are wrapped around an **iron core**. When current flows in the primary coil, it creates a changing magnetic field in the core. This changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil through **mutual inductance**.

**The output voltage level depends on the ratio of the number of turns in the primary and secondary coils.** For example, if the primary has 100 turns and the secondary has 200 turns, the output voltage will be twice the primary voltage (step-up transformer).

### **Types of Transformer:**

Transformers can be classified in many ways, such as based on their design, size, and application. Here are some common types:

* **Power Transformer:** These are large transformers that are used to change voltage levels in power distribution systems.

* **Requires low maintenance.**

## **What is an inductor?**

An inductor, sometimes called a coil or reactor, is a passive electrical component that **resists changes in electric current**. This resistance occurs through the **magnetic field** that is created when current flows through the inductor. Put in simple words, when you apply current to an inductor, it creates a magnetic field. If you try to change that current, the inductor creates an opposite magnetic field to oppose this change.

### **How ​​does this work?**

Inductors are usually made of a coiled wire wrapped around an iron or air core. When current passes through the wire, it creates a magnetic field around the core. The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the current.

If you try to increase the current, the inductor reacts by creating an opposite magnetic field. This opposite magnetic field opposes the flow of that additional current. Similarly, if you try to reduce the current, the inductor creates an opposite magnetic field to maintain the same current.

### **Properties of Inductors:**

* **Inductance**: An important property of an inductor is its **inductance**. It is measured in Henry (H). The greater the inductance, the more the inductor resists changes in current.
* **Self-induction**: When you change the current in an inductor, it induces a voltage in itself. This voltage is known as **self-induction**. Self-induction also has an opposing effect on electric current.

### **Types of Inductors:**

There are several types of inductors available for different applications:

* **Air-core inductors:** Use a core made of air, that is lightweight but has low inductance.
* **Iron Core Inductors:** Use a core made of iron, which has high inductance but is heavy.

* **Frequency Adjustment**: To set the frequency in a tuning circuit, such as in a radio.
* **Energy Storage**: For short-term energy storage, such as in a camera flash.
* **In electric motors**: To make the operation of the motor smooth.

### **Advantages of Inductors:**

* Effectively resist changes in current.
* Simple construction and durable.
* Adaptable to various applications.
