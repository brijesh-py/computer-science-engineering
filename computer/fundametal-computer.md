# **Fundamentals of Computer**

## Historical Evolution of Computers:

1. **First Generation (1940s-1950s):**
   - Vacuum tubes for processing.
   - Examples: ENIAC, UNIVAC.

2. **Second Generation (1950s-1960s):**
   - Transistors replaced vacuum tubes.
   - Examples: IBM 1401, IBM 7094.

3. **Third Generation (1960s-1970s):**
   - Integrated circuits introduced.
   - Examples: IBM System/360, DEC PDP-8.

4. **Fourth Generation (1970s-1980s):**
   - Microprocessors brought personal computers.
   - Examples: IBM PC, Apple II.

5. **Fifth Generation (1980s-Present):**
   - VLSI technology, parallel processing.
   - Examples: Modern PCs, smartphones.
