# **Fundamentals of Internet**

## Concepts of Computer Network:

- **Computer Network:** Interconnected computers sharing resources and information.
- **Communication:** Exchange of data between computers.

## Client-Server Model:

- **Client:** Requests services or resources.
- **Server:** Provides services or resources.

## Peer-to-Peer Model:

- Computers communicate directly without a central server.

## Networking Devices:

1. **Switch:** Connects devices in a LAN, operates at the data link layer.
2. **Router:** Connects different networks, manages traffic between them.
3. **Hub:** Basic networking device that connects multiple devices.
4. **Bridge:** Connects similar network segments.
5. **Gateway:** Connects different networks, translates protocols.

## Network Types:

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Limited geographical area.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Larger than LAN, city-wide.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Spans large geographical areas.

## Network Topology:

- Physical arrangement of devices in a network. Examples: Bus, Star, Ring.

## Internet, Intranet, Extranet:

- **Internet:** Global network of interconnected computers.
- **Intranet:** Private network within an organization.
- **Extranet:** Allows limited external access to an organization's network.

## Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Its Relevance:

- **ISP:** Provides internet access to customers.
- **Relevance:** Essential for connecting to the internet.

## Role of Modem in Accessing the Internet:

- **Modem:** Converts digital data from a computer to analog signals for transmission over phone lines.
- Connects a computer to the internet via a phone line or cable.

## Installation Procedure of a Modem Using Control Panel:

- Connect the modem to the computer.
- Access the Control Panel.
- Configure modem settings and establish a connection.

## Purpose of Web Browser Software:

- **Web Browser:** Software for accessing information on the internet.
- Purpose: Display web pages, navigate websites, and access online content.

## URL, URI, URN, WWW:

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** Web address.
- **URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):** Identifies resources.
- **URN (Uniform Resource Name):** Identifies resources by name.
- **WWW (World Wide Web):** A system of interlinked hypertext documents.

## Internet Protocols:

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Transfers files between computers.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for web page communication.

## Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) and Telnet:

- **RDC:** Allows remote access to a computer's desktop.
- **Telnet:** Protocol for remote terminal access.

## Email and Process of Sending/Receiving:

- **Email (Electronic Mail):** Electronic messages sent over the internet.
- **Process:** Compose, send, receive, and manage messages using email clients.

## Transmission Modes:

- **Simplex:** One-way communication.
- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way communication, one at a time.
- **Full-Duplex:** Simultaneous two-way communication.

## IP Address and Its Format:

- **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):** Identifies a device on a network.
- Format: Four sets of numbers separated by dots (IPv4) or hexadecimal (IPv6).

## MAC Address:

- **MAC Address (Media Access Control Address):** Unique identifier for network interfaces.

## DNS (Domain Name System):

- Translates domain names to IP addresses.

## Search Engines:

- Tools that help users find information on the internet. Examples: Google, Bing.

## Social Network Sites:

- Platforms for users to connect, share, and communicate. Examples: Facebook, Twitter.

## Internet Security:

- Measures to protect systems, data, and users from online threats.

## Firewall:

- Security barrier between a private network and the internet.

## Cloud Computing and Its Services:

- **Cloud Computing:** Providing computing resources over the internet.
- **Services:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS).

This overview covers the fundamental concepts of the internet, computer networks, various protocols, and services associated with online communication and data transfer.
